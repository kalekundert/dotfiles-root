## Sudoers allows particular users to run various commands as
## the root user, without needing the root password.
##
## Examples are provided at the bottom of the file for collections
## of related commands, which can then be delegated out to particular
## users or groups.
## 
## This file must be edited with the 'visudo' command.

## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on 
## which machines (the sudoers file can be shared between multiple
## systems).
## Syntax:
##
## 	user	MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands without a password
%wheel	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL
